# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project implements an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI using the Minimax algorithm, a classic adversarial search technique in artificial intelligence. The AI evaluates all possible future game states to always make the optimal move, serving as a foundational example of decision-making in turn-based games.
